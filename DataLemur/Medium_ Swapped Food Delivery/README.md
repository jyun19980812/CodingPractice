### Problem Description

**Difficulty: Medium, Topic: Correcting Swapped Food Delivery Orders**

Zomato, a popular food delivery service, encountered a delivery issue where the items in consecutive orders were swapped due to a system error. As a data analyst, your task is to correct the swapped pairings of **order IDs** and **items**.

### Requirements:
1. Each item in the **orders** table has been swapped with the item in the subsequent row. Your task is to reassign the correct pairings of **order_id** and **item**.
2. If the **last order** has an **odd order_id**, it should remain unchanged and retain its original pairing with the item.
3. Return the corrected pairings in the form of **corrected_order_id** and **item**.

### Table Schema:

- **orders** table:

| Column Name | Type    | Description                         |
|-------------|---------|-------------------------------------|
| order_id    | integer | The unique ID for each Zomato order |
| item        | string  | The name of the food item ordered   |

### Input Example:

**orders** table (incorrect data):

| order_id | item            |
|:--------:|:----------------:|
| 1        | Chow Mein        |
| 2        | Pizza            |
| 3        | Pad Thai         |
| 4        | Butter Chicken   |
| 5        | Eggrolls         |
| 6        | Burger           |
| 7        | Tandoori Chicken |

### Output Columns:
- **corrected_order_id**: The corrected order ID.
- **item**: The corresponding item after the swap is corrected.

### Output Example:

**Corrected orders** table:

| corrected_order_id | item            |
|:------------------:|:----------------:|
| 1                  | Pizza            |
| 2                  | Chow Mein        |
| 3                  | Butter Chicken   |
| 4                  | Pad Thai         |
| 5                  | Burger           |
| 6                  | Eggrolls         |
| 7                  | Tandoori Chicken |

### Explanation:
- The first and second items are swapped: **Order ID 1** is now associated with **Pizza**, and **Order ID 2** is now paired with **Chow Mein**.
- Similarly, the third and fourth items are swapped: **Order ID 3** is now associated with **Butter Chicken**, and **Order ID 4** is paired with **Pad Thai**.
- The same swapping occurs for **Order ID 5** and **Order ID 6**, resulting in the correct pairings of **Burger** and **Eggrolls**, respectively.
- **Order ID 7**, which is odd and the last item, remains unchanged, keeping **Tandoori Chicken** as its associated item.

### Approach:
1. Use a query to swap the **item** values for consecutive **order_id** rows.
2. Ensure that the last row, if it has an odd **order_id**, remains unchanged.
3. Return the **corrected_order_id** and **item** in the output.

This solution addresses the problem by realigning the order IDs with their correct items, ensuring that the error is resolved without losing any data.
